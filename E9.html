    <h2>1)BMW S1000RR: 196 mph</h2>
    <img src="C:\Users\R.Daswanta kumar\Downloads\e10p1.jpeg">
    <p>Since 2009, the BMW S1000RR has been pushing the boundaries of performance. Everything from the lightweight frame to the low-drag design is purpose-built to create the ultimate riding experience.<br>

        The S1000RR’s 205-horsepower inline-4 engine provides exceptional acceleration throughout the entire power curve, allowing it to find a top speed of 188 mph. Fast enough to win multiple Isle of Man TT races and bring bragging rights to any track it graces.</p>
    <h2>2)MV Agusta F4 R 312: 194 mph</h2>
    <img src="C:\Users\R.Daswanta kumar\Downloads\e10p2.jpeg">
    <p>For a company like MV Agusta, there’s no such thing as good enough. Perfection is the goal, and it’s an endless pursuit of an ever-moving target.<br>

        After the unbridled success of the MV Agusta F4 CC and its closely-related F4 1000 R sibling, the brand continued to fine-tune the beastly machine. In late 2007, the MV Agusta F4 R 312 was released, taking its name from the impressive 312 km/h top speed.</p>
    <h2>3)Suzuki GSX1300 R Hayabusa: 194 mph</h2>
    <img src="C:\Users\R.Daswanta kumar\Downloads\e10p3.jpeg">
    <p>With abundant power and all-around performance, the Hayabusa’s introduction to the market in 1999 was a monumental occasion with a record-setting top speed of 194 mph.<br>

        Somehow Suzuki managed to control the 197 horsepower engine and make one of the fastest motorcycles in the world enjoyable to ride regularly. Who says you can’t have it all?</p>
